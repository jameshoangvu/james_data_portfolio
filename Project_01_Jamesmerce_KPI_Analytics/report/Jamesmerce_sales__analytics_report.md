## 4. Impact of Discount Policy
![](https://github.com/jameshoangvu/james_data_portfolio/blob/main/Project_01_Jamesmerce_KPI_Analytics/report/images/Jamesmerce_dashboard_analytics02.png)
- Revenue & profit mainly come from products with **no discount (0%)** or **low discount (10–20%)**.  
- Higher discounts (≥30%–80%):  
  - Very low sales volume.  
  - Profit even turns negative.  

 **Conclusion:** Deep discounting has not been effective. Discount strategies should be adjusted to optimize profit instead of relying on heavy price cuts.

### 5.1 Quantity by Category
- **Office Supplies:** 60.05%  
- **Furniture:** 21.55%  
- **Technology:** 18.4%  

**Insight:**  
- Office Supplies sell the most in terms of volume but have lower profit margins.  
- Technology sells less but generates higher profit margins (e.g., Canon Copier).  

### 5.2 Quantity by Segment
- **Consumer:** 51.73%  
- **Corporate:** 30.67%  
- **Home Office:** 17.6%  

**Insight:**  
- The Consumer segment account for the majority of sales volume.  
- When applying filters, data shows that **Consumer** (individual customers), despite being smaller-scale buyers, also purchase Technology products significantly.  
  - Contribution: ~16K quantity and ~$107K profit across 4 years — nearly equal to the combined contribution of Corporate and Home Office.
   ![](https://github.com/jameshoangvu/james_data_portfolio/blob/main/Project_01_Jamesmerce_KPI_Analytics/report/images/Jamesmerce_dashboard_analytics04.png) 
- **Strategy:** Maintain Office Supplies for traffic/volume, while pushing Technology sales to both **Corporate and Consumer** segments to maximize profit.
