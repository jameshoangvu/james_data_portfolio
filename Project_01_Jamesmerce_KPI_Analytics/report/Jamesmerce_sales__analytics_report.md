![](https://github.com/jameshoangvu/james_data_portfolio/blob/main/Project_01_Jamesmerce_KPI_Analytics/report/images/Jamesmerce_dashboard_analytics02.png)
- Revenue & profit mainly come from products with **no discount (0%)** or **low discount (10–20%)**.  
- Higher discounts (≥30%–80%):  
  - Very low sales volume.  
  - Profit even turns negative.  

👉 **Conclusion:** Deep discounting has not been effective. Discount strategies should be adjusted to optimize profit instead of relying on heavy price cuts.

  - Contribution: ~16K quantity and ~$107K profit across 4 years — nearly equal to the combined contribution of Corporate + Home Office.  
- **Strategy:** Maintain Office Supplies for traffic/volume, while pushing Technology sales to both **Corporate and Consumer** segments to maximize profit.
